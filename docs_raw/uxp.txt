Premiere Pro UXP API
Modern extensibility powering the design of custom tools and features, allowing unparalleled workflow efficiency to be introduced into any unique Premiere Pro environments.
Overview
UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) is a scripting platform built into Premiere Pro. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere Pro functions at a programatic level. With UXP, unique tools can be built to integrate with and optimize the most precise and demanding workflows, reducing repetition, maximizing efficiency and leveraging Premiere Pro into a bespoke application customized for the needs of any project.
Best of all, UXP Plugins run right in Premiere Pro.
Premiere Pro offers a specific set of UXP functionality that extends the common base UXP API across all UXP-capable Adobe Applications. Documentation for both the Premiere Pro API and the base UXP API can be accessed via this site.
Features
Fast, Interactive Development. Load, launch and update panels directly without having to relaunch Premiere Pro.
Built In Debuggger. Trace code quickly using the built-in debugger that attaches natively to Premiere Pro.
Threaded Execution. UXP operates in parallel with other Premiere Pro processes. Continue working in Preimere Pro while UXP Plugin functions are running.
Updates
The Premiere Pro UXP API, along with this documentation website, will be updated periodically to further expand functionality as new versions of Premiere Pro are released and new features are developed.
